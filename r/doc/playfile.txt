PLAYFILE SYNTAX:

channel, data, direction, delay
#comment

    channel: 0 through NCHANNELS; 
        0 is reserved for GLOBAL commands

    data: the desired (0-4095) DAC digital resolution value.

    direction: 0 is negative 
               1 is positive
               <0 indicates no change in direction (i.e., the parser disregards it)

    delay: the time in ms to wait before transmitting the next packet.
        packet breaks are determined by a non-zero delay. I.e., all commands with 0-delay
        after them will be gathered into the same packet.
