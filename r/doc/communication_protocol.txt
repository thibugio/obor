    1. Serial Packet Specification
        
        BIT(S)      Function

        1           Good/Bad    (from ucontroller; always '1' from PC)                       
        2-4         Cmd Index   (the specific command number; supports sending multiple cmds one after another)
        5-8         Cmd Count   (how many commands are in the packet)                        
                                                                                             
        (the following 24 bits are repeated N (cmd_count) times)                             
        ------------------------                                                             
        9-12       Address     (which channel this command is addressed to)                 
        13-16       Cmd        (Poll, Enable, Update, Direction)                            
        17-28       Data       (12-bit data for the DAC; ignored depending on command)      
        29-32       Reserved   (4-bit checksum for individual command)                       
        ------------------------                                                            
        33-35       Cmd Index   (same as above, bits 2-4)                                    
        36-40       Reserved                                                                  
        41-48       Checksum    (Fletcher 8-bit checksum for entire packet)
